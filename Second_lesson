HOW TO BACKTRACK
Generalizations
Congratulations! You’ve learned three different ways to backtrack in Git. You can use these skills to undo changes made to your Git project.

Let’s take a moment to review the new commands:

git checkout HEAD filename: Discards changes in the working directory.
git reset HEAD filename: Unstages file changes in the staging area.
git reset commit_SHA: Resets to a previous commit in your commit history.
Additionally, you learned a way to add multiple files to the staging area with a single command:

git add filename_1 filename_2
