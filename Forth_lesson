GIT TEAMWORK
generalizations
Congratulations, you now know enough to start collaborating on Git projects! Let’s review.

A remote is a Git repository that lives outside your Git project folder. Remotes can live on the web, on a shared network or even in a separate folder on your local computer.
The Git Collaborative Workflow are steps that enable smooth project development when multiple collaborators are working on the same Git project.
We also learned the following commands

git clone: Creates a local copy of a remote.
git remote -v: Lists a Git project’s remotes.
git fetch: Fetches work from the remote into the local copy.
git merge origin/master: Merges origin/master into your local branch.
git push origin <branch_name>: Pushes a local branch to the origin remote.
Git projects are usually managed on Github, a website that hosts Git projects for millions of users. With Github you can access your projects from anywhere in the world by using the basic workflow you learned here.
