GIT BRANCHING
generalizations
Let’s take a moment to review the main concepts and commands from the lesson before moving on.

Git branching allows users to experiment with different versions of a project by checking out separate branches to work on.
The following commands are useful in the Git branch workflow.

git branch: Lists all a Git project’s branches.
git branch branch_name: Creates a new branch.
git checkout branch_name: Used to switch from one branch to another.
git merge branch_name: Used to join file changes from one branch to another.
git branch -d branch_name: Deletes the branch specified.
